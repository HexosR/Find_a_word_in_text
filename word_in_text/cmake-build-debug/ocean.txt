Dr Pippa Moore from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences, Aberystwyth University states that “Our research has shown that a wide range of marine organisms, which inhabit the intertidal to the deep-sea and are found from the poles to the tropics have responded to recent climate change by changing their distribution, phenology or demography.” Dr Moore goes on to say “These results highlight the urgent need for governments around the globe to develop adaptive management plans to ensure the continued sustainability of the world’s oceans and the goods and services they provide to human society.”
