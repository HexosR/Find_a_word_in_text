We hope that the information provided in these pages will help you to plan and prepare your trip to Aberystwyth as well as give you an idea of the activities that will be taking place in the first few days of the academic year.  We realise that coming to university is a daunting experience, this is particularly so for international students, we therefore encourage you to come and visit the International Office as soon as you arrive so that we can meet you and help you with any of your needs.  You can find us in the Cledwyn Building, Penglais, on the second floor.  Welcome to Aberystwyth University!
